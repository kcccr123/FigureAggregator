<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Personal learning project for Full-stack development.

Using Puppeteer, product data from various online stores is autonomously scraped at scheduled intervals in a cloud-based environment hosted on Heroku.

Express.js is employed to build the server-side framework, handling API requests, user sessions, and dynamic content delivery. The scraped data is stored in a MySQL database on Heroku, allowing the website to retrieve and display updated product information.

The website features basic search functions and filters, enhancing user experience and making it easy for visitors to browse and find products.
