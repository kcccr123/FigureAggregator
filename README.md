<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Personal learning project for Full-stack development.

Using Puppeteer, product data from various online stores is autonomously scraped at scheduled intervals in a cloud-based environment hosted on Heroku. The data is stored in a MySQL database on the same platform, allowing the website to dynamically retrieve and display relevant information to users.

Website includes basic search functions and filters for ease of browsing.
